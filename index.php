				<h2>The company</h2>
				<p>HSAP is an IT environment that provides hosting for new and innovative applications characterized by an experimental profile. HSAP offers students, academics and education related start-ups the opportunity to host innovative software solutions in a semi-professional environment.  
HSAP has evolved from the existing Hanze Professional Learning Environment and is, in fact, an organization with a similar infrastructure, although scaled up to a much larger organization. 
Although the management of this organization has grown proportionally to it and has been scaled up as well, the management of the processes has been left out of this Case, with the aim for you to design a process control environment for the organization.
Below you will find a detailed description of the organization and of the IT infrastructure.

				<h3>The 265 members of Congress who sold you out to ISPs, and how much it cost to buy them</h3>
				<p>Republicans in Congress just voted to reverse a landmark FCC privacy rule that opens the door for ISPs to sell customer data. Lawmakers provided no credible reason for this being in the interest of Americans, except for vague platitudes about “consumer choice” and “free markets,” as if consumers at the mercy of their local internet monopoly are craving to have their web history quietly sold to marketers and any other third party willing to pay.

				<h3>The leak that cried wolf</h3>
				<p>When the Turkish Crime Family first broke into the news last week, they sounded like a crisis in the making. The group claimed to have stolen a massive trove of iCloud credentials — the first over 300 million, then as many as 559 million — and unless they got $75,000 from the company before April 7th, they would start remotely wiping phones.

				<h3>Iphone 5c yay or nay?</h3>
				<p>That, more than anything, is the message of the iPhone 5C. In previous years, the arrival of a new iPhone was accompanied by the low-key repositioning of the previous model at a lower price tier — a strategy that allowed Apple to sell $99 iPhones, but didn’t allow the company to advertise them as new, interesting products. The old models sat with quiet pride in the corner of the Apple Store as people flocked in to see the latest magic from Cupertino, heralded by no banner except that of glories past.
